- 👋 Hi, I’m @Emerick2
- 👀 I’m interested in programming with **Unity** in **C#**, as well as **Python**, **JS**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and the history of all these languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the history of computing and creating original video games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my 2D platformer game project called "Cours Larvuce"! It’s a great game, but I need more levels, so if you’d like to help me bring it to life, feel free to reach out!
- 📫 You can contact me by email at pacaudemerick@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I create small games for my friends’ birthdays or festive events. If you’d like to work on a project with me, I’d be very happy to participate!
